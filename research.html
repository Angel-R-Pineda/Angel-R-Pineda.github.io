          <h3>Research Overview</h3>
          <p align="justify">
          My research is in statistical inference in medical imaging.  Most medical imaging tasks can
          be viewed as the estimation of a parameter (such as the size of a tumor) or detection of a lesion under various types
          of uncertainty.  My work tries to optimize performance of medical imaging systems on these tasks. Currently my research focuses on using 
          statistical detection theory to optimize acquisition and reconstruction in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for reconstructions generated using neural networks. 
         
          </p><h3>Optimizing Acquisition and Reconstruction of undersampled MRI for signal detection using neural networks</h3>
          <p align="justify">
           Efforts to accelerate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) require evaluation of how the acceleration affects the clinical tasks.  In this work, we use
           statistical detection of signals as a way of optimizing the methods to accelerate MRI.  The project combines psychophysical studies of humans detecting tumors with
		   mathematical models to develop model observers that can predict human performance in the detection tasks including search.  These observers are then used to optimize both the acquisition
		   and reconstruction of undersampled MRI images.  The reconstruction methods include neural networks and data agreement which introduce interesting questions in optimization
		   and machine learning.  This work is done in collaboration with student researchers
		   at Manhattan College, and consultants at the University of Southern California, University of California, Santa Barbara, University of Wisconsin, Madison and New York University.  This project was previously funded by 
		   <a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9880534&icde=52601021">  NIH R-15 grant 1R15EB029172-01 </a> and is 
		  currently being funded by <a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/UoQqlUTWEUCxK7CFWwPdJA/project-details/10730707">  NIH R-15 grant 2R15EB029172-02 </a>.  The code from the recently submitted
		  of published peer-reviewed articles from my group can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/MoMI-Manhattan-College">  MoMI Manhattan College GitHub page </a>.
