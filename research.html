          <h3>Research Overview</h3>
          <p align="justify">
          My research is in statistical inference in medical imaging.  Most medical imaging tasks can
          be viewed as the estimation of a parameter (such as the size of a tumor) or detection of a lesion under various types
          of uncertainty.  My work tries to optimize performance of medical imaging systems on these tasks. Currently my research focuses on using 
          statistical detection theory to optimize acquisition and reconstruction in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
         
          </p><h3>Optimizing Acquisition and Reconstruction of undersampled MRI for signal detection</h3>
          <p align="justify">
           Efforts to accelerate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) require evaluation of how the acceleration affects the clinical tasks.  In this work, we use
           statistical detection of signals as a way of optimizing the methods to accelerate MRI.  The project combines psychophysical studies of humans detecting tumors with
		   mathematical models to develop model observers that can predict human performance in the detection tasks.  These observers are then used to optimize both the acquisition
		   and reconstruction of undersampled MRI images.  The reconstruction methods include compressed sensing and neural networks which introduce interesting questions in optimization
		   and machine learning.  This work is done in collaboration with student researchers
		   at Manhattan College and researchers at the University of Iowa, University of Southern California and University of California, Santa Barbara.  This project is funded by 
		   <a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9880534&icde=52601021">  NIH R-15 grant 1R15EB029172-01 </a>.
