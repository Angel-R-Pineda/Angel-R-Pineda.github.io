          <h3>Personal Overview</h3>
          <p align="justify">
          The reason why this section is in my work web page is because what a person does with their time outside of work
          can affect their professional interactions.  I was honored to be included in a book about Latinx and Hispanic mathematicians, <a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=CLRM/67"> Testimonios. </a>  
          The book is free to members of the American Mathematical Society and my chapter in the book is available online through the <a href="https://www.mathvalues.org/masterblog/testimonios-dr-angel-ramn-pineda-fortn"> Math Values Blog. </a>  
          That chapter was an amazing opportunity for me to share my mathematical story starting with my grandmothers (abuelitas). </p>
            
<p align="justify"> People who are passionate about mathematics usually have a passion in other aspects in their life as well :-) Here are some of the things I do when I am not doing math: </p>
<p align="justify"> Family: I am married and have two sons.  My life now centers around a partnership in adventures together with my wife and sons.  </p>
<p align="justify"> Travel: My biggest travel adventure was in between my postdoc and tenure track job when I backpacked through South America for 3 months.  Other cool trips I have been lucky enough to take have been to Ivory Coast, Japan, India and Southeast Asia. A recent discovery is the joy of walking for a long time and then eating delicious food and drinking wine in the Camino de Santiago de Compostela.</p>
<p align="justify"> Exercise: It is a great way to get those endorphins going and to reduce stress, because of this I even justify exercise as a way to increase overall productivity.  My athletic highlights have been running the Big Sur marathon in just under 4 hours and leading 4 pitches of traditional climbing at Cat in The Hat in Red Rocks.  These days, I just try to stay active.</p>
<p align="justify"> Community Service:  My parents are doctors in a public hospital in Honduras. Because of this, I have always been interested in community service.  My most meaningful service project has been combining my love of travel, mathematics and service by volunteering for the International Mathematical Union.</p>
<p align="justify"> Dancing: I love to dance but as a young boy, I was called "the robot" by my cousins.  I very rarely get called that any more but I am by no means a good dancer.  I love dancing anything from Argentine tango to hip hop.</p>
<p align="justify"> Books: I am a slow reader but love it nonetheless.  My favorite books are The Little Prince, The Master and Margarita and a Hundred Years of Solitude.  My favorite math book is Linear Algebra and its Applications by Gilbert Strang.</p>

        My parents were medical doctors in a public hospital in Honduras and are a huge inspiration for everything I do.

        Bali is a place that helps you remember to treat everyone with kindness.
